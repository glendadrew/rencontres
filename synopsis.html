   <h2>I’ll Fly Away: A Murmuration for Justice</h2>

<p><em>I’ll Fly Away: A Murmuration for Justice</em> presents a display of hope, faith and resoluteness in the face of despair and incarceration. </p>

<p>Three framed prints on rice paper, each featuring a pixelated image generated by our own custom algorithm, highlights the diaristic words of women writing while imprisoned. </p>

<p>Through Augmented Reality, a visual dust storm of pixels rise from the bottom of each print. While the 'pixeldust' swirls in a pattern of the murmuration of birds, an autobiographical statement is heard and displayed, describing hopelessness, despair or fear expressed in that person's life. As the voice/text ends, the pixels assemble and reveal the person's identity, easily recognizable figures who are world renowned for overcoming their despair and making exemplary contributions to our world.</p>
